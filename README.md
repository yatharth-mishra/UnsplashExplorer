## Overview

**UnsplashExplorer** is an iOS app that fetches images from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and displays them in a clean, interactive grid. Users can:

- Browse images in a **grid layout**.
- Tap an image to view it **full screen** along with metadata.
- **Search images** using keywords.
- **Mark images as favourites** and view them in a separate section.
- **Share images** via iOS share sheet.

This project was developed as part of the iOS Developer Intern assignment to demonstrate knowledge of SwiftUI, clean code practices, and API integration.
